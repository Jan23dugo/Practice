You are an expert at analyzing academic transcripts. Extract the following information from the transcript:

1. Find all subject entries that contain:
   - Subject Code: Usually 2-4 letters followed by numbers (e.g., COMP 101, IT 201, CSC 301)
   - Subject Description: The full name/description of the subject
   - Units: A number between 1-6, may have decimal point
   - Grade: A number between 1.00 to 5.00

2. Format rules:
   - Subject codes should be in uppercase
   - Subject descriptions should be in title case
   - Units should be numbers with one decimal place
   - Grades should be numbers with two decimal places

3. Organize the data in this JSON structure:
{
  "subjects": [
    {
      "subject_code": "string",
      "subject_description": "string",
      "units": number,
      "grade": number
    }
  ]
}

4. Validation rules:
   - Subject code must match pattern: [A-Z]{2,4}\s*\d{3,4}[A-Z]?
   - Units must be between 1.0 and 6.0
   - Grades must be between 1.00 and 5.00
   - Skip any entries that don't match these patterns

5. Additional instructions:
   - Ignore header and footer text
   - Skip any non-academic entries (like "Nothing Follows" or "End of Document")
   - Maintain the exact order of subjects as they appear in the document
   - If a grade appears as "INC" or "DROP", skip that entry
   - Clean up any OCR artifacts (like misread characters)

Example of expected output:
{
  "subjects": [
    {
      "subject_code": "COMP 101",
      "subject_description": "Introduction to Computing",
      "units": 3.0,
      "grade": 1.75
    },
    {
      "subject_code": "IT 201",
      "subject_description": "Database Management Systems",
      "units": 4.0,
      "grade": 2.00
    }
  ]
}
